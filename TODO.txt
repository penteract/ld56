Clicking
  // just do it already

Ant AI
  // search
  // collision behavior
  Give each ant its own colour to make it easier to see what's happening if lots of ants are bunched up






Important:
Basic UI:
  controls to just place dirt/just dig/both(current setting)
    cancel orders
  speed (increase, decrease, pause)

  tutorial
  make sure the core gameplay works decently
    (i.e. do nothing and the queen dies, do a bit and she lives a while longer)
    difficulty slider / increase over time
  Find a screenshot that shows the right idea without solving the game

Optional:
  Polish
    audio
      raindrop effects
    allow explicitly building dirt vs tunnel

  Stuff that isn't dirt(movable food/queen/grubs)
    - add functionality for them (queen spawns grubs, grubs grow into ants, maybe queen needs food to produce grubs)
    Important Idea: queen isn't an instance of Ant

    procedural generation of food? maybe higher density along diagonals from start to incentivise horizontal expansion which is harder


  Fancier graphics
    I feel like this is optional. Animating water movement would be quite tricky
    colourblindness mode? (letters on solids/ants)


Ants should to know when they are doing something that wasn't specifically ordered, e.g. dragging dirt to air that hadn't been ordered to be filled

instruction types
  grub nursery
   grubs not in a nursery search for routes to an unoccupied, untargeted, unordered nursery. If they find one, they create worker orders on themselves and affiliated grub placement orders on the nursery.
  queens work similarly, but there can only be at most 1 "queen nursery".

  icon for combined dig and place dirt?

  order for "place actual dirt, not jsut tunnel"

  Maybe add buttons for "clear all tasks" and "send ants to safety"


convince ants not to kill themselves


difficulty increase over time
  we want players to lose eventually and ideally in ~5 minutes
  patterns of water varing across space

Tutorial


efficient searching (when there are lots of ants, don't have them all repeatedly decide they can't find something)
  preprocess orderes to see if (a) some of them have unoccupied ants nearby, and (b) if some of them are unreachable
