Ant AI

  Give each ant its own colour to make it easier to see what's happening if lots of ants are bunched up






Important:
Basic UI:
  controls to just place dirt/just dig/both(current setting)
    cancel orders
  speed (increase, decrease, pause)

  tutorial
  make sure the core gameplay works decently
    (i.e. do nothing and the queen dies, do a bit and she lives a while longer)
    difficulty slider / increase over time
  Find a screenshot that shows the right idea without solving the game

Optional:
  Polish
    audio
      raindrop effects
    allow explicitly building dirt vs tunnel

  Stuff that isn't dirt(movable food/queen/grubs)
    - add functionality for them (queen spawns grubs, grubs grow into ants, maybe queen needs food to produce grubs)
    Important Idea: queen isn't an instance of Ant

    procedural generation of food? maybe higher density along diagonals from start to incentivise horizontal expansion which is harder


  Fancier graphics
    I feel like this is optional. Animating water movement would be quite tricky
    colourblindness mode? (letters on solids/ants)


Ants should to know when they are doing something that wasn't specifically ordered, e.g. dragging dirt to air that hadn't been ordered to be filled
