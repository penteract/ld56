  Give each ant its own colour to make it easier to see what's happening if lots of ants are bunched up




Important:
Basic UI:
  controls to just place dirt/just dig/both(current setting)
    cancel orders
  speed (increase, decrease, pause)

  tutorial
  make sure the core gameplay works decently
    (i.e. do nothing and the queen dies, do a bit and she lives a while longer)
    difficulty slider / increase over time
  Find a screenshot that shows the right idea without solving the game

Optional:
  Polish
    audio
      raindrop effects
    allow explicitly building dirt vs tunnel

  Stuff that isn't dirt(movable food/queen/grubs)
    Important Idea: queen isn't an instance of Ant


  Fancier graphics
    I feel like this is optional. Animating water movement would be quite tricky



 Current confusing behavior:
   If an ant decides to drop some dirt, ready to recalculate paths next turn, that dropped dirt interferes with other ants pathfinding, causing them to 'correctly' abandon attempts to take dirt somewhere useful?
