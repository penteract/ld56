Clicking
  // just do it already

Ant AI
  // search
  // collision behavior
  Give each ant its own colour to make it easier to see what's happening if lots of ants are bunched up


Fancier graphics
  I feel like this is optional. Animating water movement would be quite tricky


Basic UI:
  controls to just place dirt/just dig/both(current setting)
  speed (increase, decrease, pause)

One of the following:
  Polish
    audio
      raindrop effects
    allow explicitly building dirt vs tunnel
    tutorial
    make sure the core gameplay works decently
      (i.e. do nothing and the queen dies, do a bit and she lives a while longer)
  Stuff that isn't dirt(movable food/queen/grubs)
    Important Idea: queen isn't an instance of Ant
