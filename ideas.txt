Mutation
  - absorb ideas may work here
  - genetics/animal breeding (could also work with tiny creatures)
  - functional programming :P

Side effects
 - "sides"
 - something in 4d (4d maze!)
 - rolling cube puzzle
 - geometry
 - under pressure examples

Salvage
 - chess where you play one turn then pass the board to somebody else
Shelter
 - construct shelter, find shelter (survival game)

Isolation
  - survival game

  - under pressure/submarine
  - digging/mining
Lost signal
  - a sign that someone is lost
  - cell tower arrangement
    - heightmap
Connections
  - lost signal, pathways
  - points on a graph
Strange machines
 - physics simulation/construction
 - spacechem with irrational numbers and without the layout questions
Ruins
 - Exploring a ruins
 - actively ruining something
 - playing with fire ideas
Break the cycle
 - edges to remove in directed graph to break all cycles
   - this also works for connections
